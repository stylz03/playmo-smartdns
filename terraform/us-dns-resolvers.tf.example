# Example: US-based DNS resolvers configuration
# This file shows how to configure BIND9 to use US-based DNS resolvers
# instead of Google DNS for geo-unblocking

# Option 1: Use US-based public DNS resolvers
# Note: Most public DNS resolvers return IPs based on query source location
# For true SmartDNS, you need a SmartDNS provider's DNS servers

# Option 2: Use static A records (recommended)
# Configure BIND9 to return specific US CDN IPs for streaming domains
# This is more reliable and doesn't depend on external DNS resolvers
